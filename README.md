# accessibility

Website accessibility is becoming increasingly important in 2023,
According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 1.3billion people experience significant disability. This represents 16% of the world’s population, or 1 in 6 of us, I.e over 1 billion people worldwide are not able to browse the internet in an effective and integrated manner.
 
And we take accessibility very seriously and adhere to the WCAG standards and thrive to enhance our website to make it more user friendly.
 
As an additional support for our existing accessibility support, we have come up with an idea of an accessibility widget which will help make our website accessible for Everyone.
 
About our widget:
 
We have 2 divisions on our widget, one lists out the profiles, the other which will have the features.
This is an enhanceable widget, so we can add more profiles and features based on the research.
 
A small demo on the widget,
Seizure:
When a person who is sensitive to flashy images, videos chooses the profile, we transform the whole website to low saturation and pause all the videos on the website so that she can have a better viewing experience.
 
Visually impaired people will have a low vision:
When the user clicks on impaired profile, the widget transforms the website to have a friendly experience for her, by increasing the font size, making the mouse cursor bigger and the saturation would be adjusted & also enables mute/unmute option for any video/animation
 
The other option is for her to choose from the available features such as dark contrast - on click we add the dark background so the text is visible clearly.
Highlight link: as the text says when she chooses this feature, all the links on the website gets highlighted so it’s easy for her to identify the links.
 
This will be a continuous addition/enhancement so some content may not have yet been fully adapted to the strictest accessibility standards
